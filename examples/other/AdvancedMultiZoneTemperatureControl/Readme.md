This advanced example demonstrates several sophisticated features:

1. **Multi-Zone Control**:
   - Manages multiple independent temperature zones
   - Each zone has its own heating and cooling capabilities
   - Individual setpoints and safety limits

2. **Adaptive Tuning**:
   - Monitors system response and oscillations
   - Automatically adjusts PID parameters
   - Stores best-performing parameters in EEPROM

3. **Data Logging**:
   - Records temperatures, setpoints, and PID outputs
   - Uses RTC for accurate timestamps
   - Stores data on SD card for analysis

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Tracks average and maximum errors
   - Measures response time and settling time
   - Counts oscillations for stability analysis

5. **Safety Features**:
   - Temperature limit monitoring
   - Emergency shutdown capability
   - Alarm logging

6. **Serial Interface**:
   - Remote setpoint adjustment
   - Manual tuning initiation
   - Real-time monitoring

To use this system:
1. Connect temperature sensors to the specified analog pins
2. Connect heaters and fans to PWM-capable pins
3. Install an SD card module and RTC
4. Upload the code and monitor via Serial

Serial Commands:
- Set temperature: `setpoint zone value` (e.g., "setpoint 0 25.5")
- Start tuning: `tune zone` (e.g., "tune 0")

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation or add additional features?

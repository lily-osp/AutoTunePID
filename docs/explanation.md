## 1. PID Tuning Algorithms

The `AutoTunePID` library supports multiple PID tuning algorithms, each suited for different types of systems and control scenarios. Below is a detailed explanation of each method:

---

### 1.1 Ziegler-Nichols Tuning Method

#### General Explanation

The **Ziegler-Nichols** method is one of the oldest and most widely used tuning approaches. It works by driving the system into **critical oscillation** (sustained oscillations) and then using the oscillation characteristics to compute the PID gains.

#### How It Works in the Library

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The library removes the integral (`I`) and derivative (`D`) actions and uses only the proportional (`P`) controller to induce oscillations.
2. **Induce Oscillations**:
   - The library gradually increases the proportional gain (`Kp`) until the system oscillates continuously.
3. **Record Parameters**:
   - The library measures the **ultimate gain (`Ku`)** and **ultimate period (`Tu`)** from the oscillations.
4. **Calculate PID Gains**:
   - The library uses the following formulas to calculate the PID parameters:
     - $ Kp = 0.6 \cdot Ku $
     - $ Ki = 1.2 \cdot Kp / Tu $
     - $ Kd = 0.075 \cdot Kp \cdot Tu $

#### Strengths

- Simple to implement.
- Works well for systems that can sustain oscillations.
- Provides a good starting point for PID tuning.

#### Weaknesses

- May lead to aggressive tuning, causing overshoots.
- Not suitable for systems with significant delays or nonlinear dynamics.

#### Best Use-Case

- Systems with consistent, oscillatory responses.
- Applications where slight overshoots are acceptable.

### 1.2 Cohen-Coon Tuning Method

#### General Explanation

The **Cohen-Coon** method is designed for systems with **measurable dead time**. It assumes a first-order process model and provides tuning rules for PID controllers that result in smoother responses compared to Ziegler-Nichols.

#### How It Works in the Library

1. **Identify System Parameters**:
   - The library applies a step input to the system and measures the **process gain (`K`)**, **time constant (`τ`)**, and **dead time (`L`)**.
2. **Calculate PID Gains**:
   - The library uses the following formulas:
     - $ Kp = 0.8 \cdot Ku $
     - $ Ki = Kp / (0.8 \cdot Tu) $
     - $ Kd = 0.194 \cdot Kp \cdot Tu $

#### Strengths

### 1.3 IMC-Based Tuning (Internal Model Control)

#### General Explanation

The **IMC-Based Tuning** method uses a process model to compute PID parameters, emphasizing **robustness** and **stability**. It allows the user to control the trade-off between response speed and robustness by adjusting the **closed-loop time constant (`λ`)**.

#### How It Works in the Library

1. **Obtain Process Model**:
   - The library measures the **process gain (`K`)**, **time constant (`τ`)**, and **dead time (`L`)**.
2. **Select `λ`**:
   - The user selects `λ` based on the desired trade-off between response speed and stability.
3. **Calculate PID Gains**:
   - The library uses the following formulas:
     - $ Kp = 0.4 \cdot Ku $
     - $ Ki = Kp / (2.0 \cdot \lambda) $
     - $ Kd = 0.5 \cdot Kp \cdot \lambda $

#### Strengths

- Highly robust and flexible.
- Handles dead time effectively.
- Adjustable for different performance needs.

#### Weaknesses

- Requires accurate process modeling.
- More complex than simpler methods like Ziegler-Nichols.

#### Best Use-Case

### 1.4 Tyreus-Luyben Tuning Method

#### General Explanation

The **Tyreus-Luyben** method is a robust tuning approach designed to **minimize overshoot** and improve **stability**. It is particularly useful for systems where aggressive tuning (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols) leads to instability or excessive oscillations.

#### How It Works in the Library

1. **Induce Oscillations**:
   - The library uses a relay or proportional controller to drive the system into oscillation.
2. **Record Parameters**:
   - The library measures the **ultimate gain (`Ku`)** and **ultimate period (`Tu`)**.
3. **Calculate PID Gains**:
   - The library uses the following formulas:
     - $ Kp = 0.45 \cdot Ku $
     - $ Ki = Kp / (2.2 \cdot Tu) $
     - $ Kd = 0.0 $ (No derivative term)

#### Strengths

- Minimizes overshoot and improves stability.
- Suitable for systems where aggressive tuning is undesirable.

#### Weaknesses

- Requires accurate measurement of `Ku` and `Tu`.
- Derivative action is not used, which may limit performance in some systems.

#### Best Use-Case

- Systems requiring minimal overshoot and high stability.
- Applications where aggressive tuning leads to instability.

### 1.5 Lambda Tuning (CLD)

#### General Explanation

The **Lambda Tuning (CLD)** method is designed for systems with **significant dead time**. It uses the **process time constant (`T`)**, **dead time (`L`)**, and a **tuning parameter (`λ`)** to calculate PID gains. This method provides a balance between response speed and robustness.

#### How It Works in the Library

1. **Estimate System Parameters**:
   - The library measures the **process time constant (`T`)** and **dead time (`L`)**.
2. **Select `λ`**:
   - The user selects `λ` based on the desired trade-off between response speed and robustness.
3. **Calculate PID Gains**:
   - The library uses the following formulas:
     - $ Kp = \frac{T}{K(\lambda + L)} $
     - $ Ki = \frac{Kp}{T} = \frac{1}{K(\lambda + L)} $
     - $ Kd = Kp \cdot 0.5L = \frac{0.5L \cdot T}{K(\lambda + L)} $

#### Strengths

- Handles systems with significant dead time effectively.
- Provides a balance between response speed and robustness.

#### Weaknesses

- Requires accurate measurement of `T` and `L`.
- More complex than simpler methods like Ziegler-Nichols.

#### Best Use-Case

- Systems with significant dead time.
- Scenarios requiring a balance between response speed and stability.

### 1.6 Manual Tuning

#### General Explanation

**Manual Tuning** allows the user to manually set the PID parameters (`Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd`). This method is ideal for systems with unique dynamics or when other methods fail.

#### How It Works in the Library

1. **Set PID Gains**:
   - The user manually sets the values for `Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd` using the `setManualGains()` method.
2. **Fine-Tune**:
   - The user iteratively adjusts the gains to achieve the desired system behavior.

#### Strengths

- Full control over the tuning process.
- Can accommodate systems with unique or nonlinear dynamics.

#### Weaknesses

- Time-consuming and requires expertise.
- Prone to human error or bias during adjustments.

#### Best Use-Case

- Systems with unconventional dynamics or those that cannot be modeled easily.
- Situations where other tuning methods fail to deliver satisfactory results.

## 2. System Corrector

The **System Corrector** is a feature in the `AutoTunePID` library that monitors the system's response for **instability** (e.g., oscillations or divergence) and applies corrective actions when needed.

#### How It Works

1. **Monitor System Response**:
   - The corrector analyzes historical data points (e.g., input values) to detect instability.
2. **Apply Corrective Actions**:
   - If instability is detected, the corrector reduces the output and resets the integral term to stabilize the system.
3. **Re-Tune if Necessary**:
   - If instability persists, the system enters **tuning mode** to re-tune the PID gains.

#### Best Use-Case

- Systems where instability may occur due to external disturbances or changes in system dynamics.
- Applications requiring long-term stability and reliability.

---

## 3. Operational Modes

The library supports several **operational modes** to adapt to different control scenarios:

1. **Normal Mode**:
   - Standard PID operation.
2. **Reverse Mode**:
   - Reverses the error calculation for cooling systems.
3. **Hold Mode**:
   - Stops all calculations to save resources.
4. **Preserve Mode**:
   - Minimal calculations to keep the system responsive.
5. **Tune Mode**:
   - Performs auto-tuning to determine `Tu` and `Ku`.
6. **Auto Mode**:
   - Automatically selects the best operational mode based on system behavior.

---

## 4. Signal Filtering

The library supports **input and output signal filtering** using **exponential moving averages**. This helps reduce noise and improve the stability of the control system.

#### How It Works

1. **Input Filtering**:
   - Filters the input signal using an exponential moving average.
   - The filter's responsiveness can be adjusted using the `alpha` parameter.
2. **Output Filtering**:
   - Filters the output signal to smooth the control action.
   - The filter's responsiveness can also be adjusted using the `alpha` parameter.

#### Best Use-Case

- Systems with noisy input signals.
- Applications requiring smooth control actions.

---

## 5. Anti-Windup

The **Anti-Windup** feature prevents the integral term from accumulating excessively when the output is saturated, which can lead to instability.

#### How It Works

1. **Monitor Output**:
   - The library checks if the output is saturated (i.e., at the minimum or maximum value).
2. **Constrain Integral Term**:
   - If the output is saturated, the integral term is constrained to prevent windup.

#### Best Use-Case

- Systems where the output may saturate due to physical limits.
- Applications requiring stable and responsive control.
